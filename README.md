# Investigate-a-Dataset_TMDb_movie_data

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed the TMDb_movie dataset and then communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

### Dataset Introduction
The TMDB movies dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), The columns include movie id, user ratings, popularity, budget, revenue, etc. My analysis answered some questions relating to movie genres, popularity, revnue, etc.

### Why this Project?
* In this project, I went through the data analysis process and saw how everything fits together.

* I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

### What did I learn?
After completing the project, I was able to:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
* Have experience communicating the results of my analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let me access my data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
